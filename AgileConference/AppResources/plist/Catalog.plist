				<string>CONQUER CHAOS-DESIGNING THE BUSINESS</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>Companies fail every day from a lack of balance between opposing needs of “right now” profit versus investing in innovation to thrive long-term. Sometimes they struggle due to chaotic careening between the two needs. Why? Because the business system is designed to fail. This need not be! Come learn how leadership, system/design thinking, and lean/agile principles interact in the context of strategy, and how to leverage what you already know to start conquering some of these challenges. This is especially critical if you want to introduce lean/agile approaches successfully.</string>

				<string>LEAN VALUE INNOVATION</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>Lean and agile offer good ways to improve organizations but adoption is difficult when the organization is highly dysfunctional and most times adoption is not attempted or fails. Some lean and agile organizations are not as effective as they could be because of issues related to the human factor. I propose Lean Value Innovation (LVU), a framework that brings together innovative thinking, innovation fostering environment, and innovative tools/methods. LVU emphasizes the balance between value to customer and value to enterprise. Result is an acceleration in competitive advantage and maturity.</string>

				<string>STRUCTURED FREEDOM – WITH RULES AND STRATEGIES</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>Agile is about self-organizing, empowered teams. More freedom is expected than what traditional project management offers. Leaders have a challenge to balance this freedom with need for predictable outcomes. Rules are mandatory; strategies are optional. Rules provide stability and continuity, while strategies help adapt to different situations. Too many or wrong rules diminish freedom. Too few and we are in danger of losing control. The session introduces concept of “Structured freedom” and explains with examples how the right balance between rules and strategies can be achieved.</string>

How to get executives engaged in the right way, how to prioritize across projects and not only within projects and the fact that we actually do have to make higher level plans to make our agile projects fit in the big picture.

				<string>It is commonly accepted that at least 60% of all ICT project fail by one or more criteria including; schedule, budget, maintenance and return on investment. While agile projects fare better, with a 40% failure rate, this still implies a large number of failed projects. This presentation will forensically examine a failed agile project with the goal of helping agile project managers avoid similar issues in future.</string>

				<string>Coach, product owner, team lead, developer, jack-in-the-box - working as a consultant in medium sized Danish companies has given Jonas Auken a lot of experience with different roles and more often than not several roles at a time. Nowadays he lives in Delhi, coaching and developing with Indian programmers. Jonas has always been committed to excellence and he has the gift of bringing the same out in fellow developers. Jonas preaches the holistic approach to development - in his mind a key element of being agile: The whole picture is what matters! That, and getting the job done right.</string>

				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>As a Dane and a coach working in the trenches between Indian and Danish working culture I often stumble into strange prejudices. One very prevalent stereotype is that of the childish Indian. To put it in more proper words: Many of the Indian cultural traits are considered immature in the Western culture - but for all the wrong reasons!Come, learn and discuss how we - on the Indian side - can avoid this stereotype and make life easier for teams distributed across cultural gaps.</string>

				<string>CROSS-CULTURAL IMPEDIMENTS IN DISTRIBUTED SCRUM TEAMS</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>Scrum is often experienced as a very effective tool in Northern European(NE)-Indian distributed teams. However, teams often experience cross-cultural differences between NE and India: Indians are used to working in a more hierarchical environment whereas NEs are used to working in a flatter structure. NEs usually communicate more directly whereas Indians have a tendency to sugarcoat messages. In this workshop we will discuss when Scrum WORKS in NE-Indian distributed teams, and when Scrum needs to be RE-ARRANGED or SUPPLEMENTED in order to be successful in NE-Indian distributed teams.</string>

				<string>In Global Software Engineering context, there are three fundamental governance patterns that characterise the dynamics of engagement among global teams and organizations involved in software development. This session will explore these three patterns and present the indicators that differentiate distributed agile from outsourced staffing. Also, this session will present one or two case studies to illustrate transformation from one pattern to another. This session will conclude with a discussion on the most suitable governance pattern for distributed agile software development.</string>

				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>At the Forward Internet Group in London, we are implementing a more extreme version of Agile that is consistent with the Lean Startup movement. In essence, the business has empowered the developers to do what they think is right for the business. We have watched well-defined Agile roles evaporate completely as other environmental factors are applied. Finally, we have arrived at Programmer Anarchy, an organization often following none of the standard Agile practices, having no BA or QA roles, and even missing any managers of programmers, yet still conforms to the Agile Manifesto!</string>

				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>There’s a lot of the literature available on how to write and flesh out a user story - how to frame the story statement, what to include, how to write good acceptance criteria, etc. There is less written about how to carve out good, playable user stories from a complex feature or epic story in the first place. This workshop uses 3 case studies drawn from real projects to focus on this latter skill, demonstrating how close collaboration between analysts, customers, developers, testers, and UX designers can result in user stories that help iteratively evolve features and reduce delivery risk.</string>

				<string>It is a popular misconception that while Agile works great for green-field development projects, it has limited utility in third party product implementations. There isn’t much development work beyond customization and extensions and much of the process knowledge is already coded in the software. This presentation details how Agile and Learn Startup principles can deliver a more successful solution and increased business value when implementing a third-party enterprise software and how it can be applied right from the Product selection, infrastructure setup to Roll-out.</string>

				<string>SO YOU THINK YOU CAN EXTIMATE?-THE LOST ART OF USEFUL ESTIMATES</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>Developer estimates are notoriously inaccurate. A common pitfall for devs is to apply a singular model or rule to their estimates (4 points = half a day)but by nature estimates are both intuitive and subjective and when you make them collaborative, chaos ensues! Through experimentation and interaction with the physical world participants will disrupt their L-Brain thinking and get into their R-Brains. They will unlock the secrets of context-based estimation, come to know the true purpose of velocity and leave the workshop with a foundation for problem-solving when estimates get too big. </string>

				<string>I am learning software development and architecture for over 20 years and trying to be agile for more or less half that time. I believe that software development is an opportunity to break down traditional social barriers, carve out new social contracts, and to restore dignity to individuals. I spend my time trying to be a better developer, crawling with people that are trying to run, and sharing my lessons from software development and life equally. I currently head the South African operations for factor10, a leading software development consultancy based in Sweden. I blog reasonably frequently at http://aslamkhan.net.</string>

				<string>COLLABORATION LESSON FROM THE RAINBOW NATION</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>I was born a prisoner in South Africa, and my thinking was set by apartheid. Then, suddenly, I was free. But I still carried hatred, distrust and a multitude of conflicting emotions, yet I must work harmoniously with the “enemy”. The challenges of the teams with whom I work are fractals of 300 year long conflict. In this seminar, I share my life lessons as a nation transitioned peacefully from apartheid to a democracy of interwoven cultures. As a second generation South African Indian my conflicted identity helped me deal with diversity, value conflicts, and collaboration struggles in teams.</string>

				<string>THE HOLISTIC PROGRAMMER</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string> Extreme Programming teaches us that the team must be whole and self-organized - encompass all skills needed for the project. Moreover, each agile individual is responsible for the whole project - who else will when the team has no manager? This requires a holistic mindset - caring for the whole picture and caring for every detail.How is this possible? Necessary even? Success or failure? My theory is that the holistic programmer will prevail. From knowledge gathering through design, coding, testing and the final deployment - if you care for the whole process your team will be truly whole.</string>

				<string>THE STORY OF SITTING TOGETHER</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>As the practice of Agile matures, teams find great value in shortening feedback loops to inspect and adapt more often. However, constraints in the physical seating of teams drive the way in which they interact - team members in the same building communicate via email and meet only for “meetings”. XP advocates Sitting Together, but due to a lot of constraints organizations are unable or unwilling to adopt this. In this presentation we will share what these constraints are and how we were able to overcome them so that our teams could Sit Together! </string>

				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>This talk is the tale of two Scrum teams—team Shu that watched utilization and team Ha that watched lead time—diagramed on their task boards. Watching work in progress on a task board is sufficient to explain throughput, local sub-optimization, constraints, utilization, efficiency, service time, lead time—and why even Scrum teams would benefit from a Kanban. Additional maps illustrate wait time, value streams, and wastes. The result is an introduction to Lean, its pillars and principles, primarily in pictures.</string>

				<string>Personal Kanban applies Kanban’s core principles (visualize what you do, pull, limit work-in-progress) to personal work. Just as its big enterprise sibling, Personal Kanban can be your improvement engine. You can apply it to handling tasks during a sprint, conducting a business meeting, planning professional development, and other types of work. This session will both explain the principles and give you hands-on experience with Personal Kanban. You will leave with a valuable personal effectiveness and improvement tool.</string>

				<string>In this session I will share my experience working on a multi-year strategic initiative that would change the way our Firm maintained its digital presence and engagement with clients, alumni and the public. We started out with large goals but no plan on how to achieve those goals. Our IT department was asked to build. Business Sponsors had no idea if what IT built would meet the goals. A year later and millions spent, it was clear that we could not continue down the road of conversation over collaboration and documentation. That working software over contract negotiation was not enough.</string>

				<string>Transition from the PM and BA role to the PO role can be challenging but rewarding. In our organization, the PO role has tremulously evolved and we have made it a role that does not have very specific boundaries.

				<string>AGILE DECESIONS</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>Making the right choices is crucial. Decisions have generally been viewed as the prerogative of individuals - usually senior executive. The process employed, the information used, the logic relied on, have been left up to them, in something of a black box. Information goes in, decisions come out - and who knows what happens in between. Unlike other business processes, decision making has been rarely the focus of systemic thinking and analysis. This has left a significant opportunity to improve decision making as we would any other process through visibility, feedback and value.</string>

				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>There are two philosophies when adopting agile at the enterprise level: incremental or big bang. For those that choose the big bang, there are many considerations that need to be implemented to ensure a successful roll-out. A plan with short, medium and long range goals needs to be created to prevent agile from just being a fad or just slapping an agile label on a waterfall process. Join Cerner Corporation as they discuss their big bang implementation across 5 global offices and 2000+ associates in less than 6 months.</string>

				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>In the enterprise world, majority of the product releases are driven by road maps , time bound, defined early in the product development cycle. Where as Agile teams owning a product release wouldn’t have the enough visibility to commit to these dates and are often pushed to the corner and stretched to hit the dates. There is always conflict of being able to predict release date upfront and still adhering to Agile principles. This sounds, turns into oxymoron. In this experience report, the journey of connecting these 2 ends in Yahoo! Finance site modernization project is elaborated. </string>

				<string>COMMUNICATING LIKE YOU KNOW EACH OTHER IN DISTRIBUTED AGILE PROJECTS</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>Communication is the most challenging aspect of any distributed project. When we throw agile practices into the mix, which rely so much on effective communication we really need to make it work. The organizers will share practices from their experiences with offshore engagements. We found that the most important to accomplish is to really get to know each other and that there are ways to achieve that despite the geographical distance. The tutorial is based on their chapter published in the book: Agility Across Time and Space, published by Springer in 2010 (ISBN 978-3-642-12441-9).</string>

				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>What if work life were more like a game? Recent books show how we can use games and virtual worlds to improve and change the way we work and how businesses compete. This session explores how agile delivers intrinsic rewards, like social connection and meaning, and ways in which we can transform work using game thinking and mechanics to engage people and teams. This session, itself structured as a game, will challenge and equip attendees to replace traditional management practices with a gamefully designed agile workplace to create more successful organizations and more satisfied workers.</string>

				<string>Product Development can be viewed as a Complex Adaptive System. Different people, groups, organizations and systems collaborate in a complex network of relationships and dependencies to produce something of value - generally a product or service. Identifying waste in this value network is a critical step towards creating a truly lean organization. This interactive, hands-on workshop will (1) demonstrate exercises that identify waste, (2) provide a framework for managing waste, and (3) provide concrete strategies and practices for eliminating waste in your organization.</string>

				<string>INDWELLING AND OUTFLOWING,APPLYING THE JIDOKA PRINCIPLE</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>A CXO said, he expects “superior engineering and value” but how? Jidoka has in its root, a philosophy to approach this. Jidoka crudely could be said to be a system that identifies errors by itself but needs human intelligence to fix it. One of the common outflowing measure is “defect” that explains “what it is not”. Can there be indwelling measures to show “what it IS”. A sharepoint widget has 6- 8 dimensions of requirements. A measure of this shows what requirement IS. This talk covers indwelling measures across engineering for objective decision making</string>

				<string>I am learning software development and architecture for over 20 years and trying to be agile for more or less half that time. I believe that software development is an opportunity to break down traditional social barriers, carve out new social contracts, and to restore dignity to individuals. I spend my time trying to be a better developer, crawling with people that are trying to run, and sharing my lessons from software development and life equally. I currently head the South African operations for factor10, a leading software development consultancy based in Sweden. I blog reasonably frequently at http://aslamkhan.net.</string>

				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>The distinction of Scrum is the product owner; a keystone that is supported by the pillars of the team and strategic management. Whilst it offers opportunity for radical change, my observations have shown that there is a literal application of rules, unsustainable practices, and ineffective attitude towards product ownership, inclusive of the team. The end is nothing less than product owner burnout. I will share practices that I have learned from experience, that deviate from the norm, but leads to product ownership that tries to restore a balance of strategy, tactics and product development.</string>

				<string>You know Agile Software Development reasonably well, using it on a few projects. You’ve now moved on to a new group or company, and they want to “go Agile”. Since you’re the local expert, you’ve been volunteered to be the Coach. Congratulations! But what now? This session assumes that you know Agile already, and won’t delve into the minutiae of the principles and practices unless warranted by the example at hand. It uses the metaphor of our progression through the stages of life to provide a backdrop for a team’s journey towards Agility, and your journey as a Coach.</string>

				<string>BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN AGILE PROJECT TEAMS AND YOUR TRADITIONAL HR DEPARTMENT</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>Nowadays, software companies adapt agile concepts for their development teams rapidly. However, the lack of understanding of such concepts by other facilitating entities of the organization – including supporting departments –, such as HR department, may create complexities and slow down the expected return of such agile transformation by its production staff. Further with current dynamic business climate, the entire organization is challenged to deliver more with less. This session will discuss such challenges in the context as well as the solutions to overcome them.</string>

The same old issues keep recurring: unreliability, inertia, blame, bugs, downtime.I look into why building a cross-functional team involves more than just re-drawing an org chart: new practices, tools, and cultural norms need to be built-up. Drawing on experiences from a variety of organisations that have built delivery teams, I propose my top ten tips for helping development and operations people overcome their differences.</string>

				<string>Continuous Delivery is important in agile development for rapid feedback. Building a full Continuous Delivery Pipeline can seem like a daunting task. This talk will demonstrate that this is not the case by building a working Continuous Delivery pipeline in less than 1 hour. This knowledge can then be extended for use in more complex systems. The talk will introduce Rake, Powershell Remoting and YAML as tools in a .NET developers toolbox to create a simple and cost effective Continuous Delivery pipeline.</string>

				<string>EXPLORATORY TESTING FOR AGILE TEAMS(HANDS ON)</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>Those who are moving from traditional testing mindset to Agile, appear to treat testing the same way they did in the past. They end up producing large test case documents and never have time to run because the story has changed. In other cases, those who are doing exploratory testing in Agile contexts end up not doing it in ways where they know how to track and manage it. In this workshop - 1) Recognize and practice a style of exploratory testing that can be tracked and managed. 2) Plan and determine test coverage with the help of heuristics and oracles. Hands on!</string>

				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>The problem with metrics is that there are so many to choose from. Lines of code, rule violations, dependency matrices, cyclomatic/npath complexity, code coverage, duplication - the list goes on. Tracking all of these results in too much data and too little insight. In this talk, we will see how to narrow down to a small set of useful metrics. We’ll also see how aggregate metrics like toxicity help reduce the tracking footprint. Finally, we’ll look at the difference between a measurement and a target and see why measurements should not be simply converted into targets.</string>

				<string>REDUCE WASTE CAMPAGIN-ARE YOU UP FOR THE CHALLENGE?</string>
				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>Do your teams feels like they have mastered Agile development and there’s nothing that they can improve? Well, that how teams in our organization began to feel after practicing Agile development for over four years. Teams in our organization began to feel saturated. They were executing Agile projects in a harmonic rhythm. Things were running smooth in our development organization, issues were handled gracefully without any complains. How could everything be fine? If this was the plateau, we had to find a way to break it. We needed to push our teams to take Agile to the next level.</string>

				<key>Topic_Summary</key>
				<string>Story sizing is often a confusing activity and many projects find it hard to estimate complexity in terms of story points.The objective of this session is to give participants hands-on experience on using the concept of relativity while estimating in story points via a short exercise. Participants will be asked to size stories blindly and as more and more stories unfold the participants will realize that the concept of relativity has kicked in while they were busy estimating.</string>

				<string>We would like solutions delivered fast without compromising quality, user experience, implicit requirements and non-functional aspects such as scalability and performance. This would have been easier, if we had all the time in the universe. Doing this in a sustainable manner becomes a huge challenge for teams as there are multiple competing forces at play and because software development is very complex.</string>

				<string>What do a 17th century painter’s workshop, an international photographic cooperative, and an early 20th century design house have in common with a modern software development team? On the surface it may not seem like much, but bringing a group of makers together to work presents special challenges and opportunities, regardless of field. In this session we’ll explore what worked, and didn’t, for several groups of historical makers. We’ll use stories and dialogues to explore parallels with agile software development teams, and discuss coaching strategies around the examples provided.</string>
